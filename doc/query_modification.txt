Using the QBASHQ substitution rules mechanism
=============================================

18 Dec 2017.


Substitution rules work as follows: 
-----------------------------------
1. The substitution rules file contains one tab separated rule per
   line.  <LHS> TAB <RHS>
2. LHS can be any perl5-compatible regular expression including
   capturing expressions.
3. RHS is the replacement string which can include variables such
   as $2 which means “the text matched by the second capturing
   expression”.
4. Regular expression matching uses the third-party PCRE2 library
   and specifies PCRE2_UTF and PCRE2_CASELESS options.  I.e.
   matching is case-insensitive and expects patterns and strings
   in UTF-8
5. Rules are applied in the order in which they occur in the
   rules file.
6. Only one pass is made through the rules.
7. A rule may cause multiple substitutions.  E.g.
   “singing TAB singin” will replace every occurrence of ‘singing’
   in the query.
8. Substitution rules are also applied to candidate documents, UNLESS
   the RHS contain QBASHQ query operators (double quotes and square
   brackets) and UNLESS the candidate document length is less than
   256 bytes.  Note that the system allows for growth beyond 256 bytes
   as a result of substitutions. For example, a substitution rule
   might replace occurrences of 'dancin' with 'dancing' in both the
   query and candidate documents.   *** Further thought on this may
   lead to changes in this mechanism. ***


Substitution is applied after:
------------------------------
1.	Lower casing of the query.
2.	Accent removal (if accent conflation is turned on)
3.	Street address processing – Removal of things like ‘Unit 10’
        or ‘Suite 4’ plus removal and recording of house
	numbers. 


Substitution is applied before:
-------------------------------
1.	Normalization of delimiters.  (Removing punctuation, ensuring
	correct balancing of phrases and disjunctions which may have
	been introduced by substitutions.)
2.	Removal of segment-intent words, e.g lyrics segment words such
	as “words of”, “lyrics for”.
3.	Query shortening, if turned on.


Multiple substitution rules files:
----------------------------------
Substitution rules are only activated when the -use_substitions
option is set to TRUE, or ON, and the appropriate substitution rules
file exists and is readable.  When QBASHQ is used from the command
line the substition rules file is expected to be either a file name
specified explicitly as the value of -file_substitution_rules=, OR
a file in the index_dir called QBASH.substitution_rules_XX, where XX
is a two letter code supplied as the value of the -language= option.

The intention of this mechanism is to allow different sets of
substitution rules for different languages, e.g. EN, FR, DE etc.
There is nothing to stop you using any two-letter code, such as
LY (for lyrics).


Additional notes:
-----------------
Latency will deteriorate if there are too many rules in the file.  It
seems that 50 or so rules is OK but that depends upon the rules and on
the length of the queries.
